!['Plotly Pie Chart'](images/PlotlyPieChar.png)


## Goal
- To use data visualization to better explain what the government spends the nation's money on
- To use webscraping to automatically gather the new data every week and make it easily manipulatable and readily available

## Process
- Use BeautifulSoup to automatically scrape the federalreserve.gov website for the weekly statistical Release
- Clean the data and add it to a dataframe using Pandas
- Visualize the data using Plotly

## In progress
- Automating the process through WebScraping.py (The main .csv file of data was pulled using Jupyter Notebook)
- Scraping more than just the first table in the Federal Reserve Summary

## Future
- Add more visuals and data analysis
- Create Frontend to select tables, sort by data and choose visuals
